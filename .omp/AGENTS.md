# OMP Beads Template

An OMP-native project template with br as the task tracking backbone and bv for graph-informed planning. Every phase queries the graph before acting. Clean, boring, mechanical.

@memory/project/project.md
@memory/project/conventions.md

## The Workflow

Every piece of work flows through br beads. bv's robot commands drive decisions at every phase. Commands + skills only — no scripts, no machinery.

```
/brainstorm → /create → /plan → /ship → /verify → /review → /pr → /close
```

Or load the **orchestrator** skill to chain phases automatically — the agent reads the graph and decides which phase to enter next.

## Command Reference

| Command | What It Does | Reads | Writes | bv Commands |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/brainstorm` | Ideas from graph + codebase exploration | — | — | triage, suggest, priority, label-attention, plan, search, file-hotspots |
| `/create` | Formalize into bead + PRD | br state, affected code | `prd.md`, `decisions.md` | triage, suggest, plan, search, label-health |
| `/plan` | Wave-sequence with blast radius | `prd.md` | `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `context-capsule.md` | plan, impact, impact-network, blocker-chain, forecast, capacity, file-hotspots, file-relations |
| `/ship` | Implement with file awareness | `prd.md`, `plan.md` | changed source files | triage, alerts, related, impact, file-beads, file-relations |
| `/verify` | Run checks, record evidence | plan verification section | `completion-evidence.json` | triage, alerts, impact, impact-network, blocker-chain |
| `/review` | 5-agent parallel review with confidence scoring | `completion-evidence.json`, git diff | `review-report.md` | impact, related, file-beads, file-relations, suggest |
| `/pr` | Create GitHub PR (single-turn executable) | `review-report.md`, `completion-evidence.json` | PR body | — |
| `/close` | Close bead, suggest next | all artifacts | — | suggest, next, capacity |
| `/init` | Bootstrap workspace + br init | — | `.beads/` | — |
| `/git-clean` | Remove merged worktrees and local branches | — | — | — |

## Workflow Enforcement

The workflow-gate extension (`.omp/extensions/workflow-gate.ts`) blocks `edit`/`write` tools until required artifacts exist.

**You MUST follow the workflow:**
1. `/brainstorm` → `/create` → `/plan` → `/ship` → `/verify` → `/review` → `/pr` → `/close`
2. Each command checks its prerequisites. If it says "run X first," do it.
3. Do not fight the gate. If blocked, run the prerequisite.

**What gets blocked:**

| Tool | Condition | Error |
|------|-----------|-------|
| edit | No PRD for active bead | "Run /create first" |
| edit | No plan for active bead | "Run /plan first" |
| write | Same as edit | Same |

**What always passes:**
- Reading files (read tool, read-only bash)
- Writing to `.beads/` and `.omp/` (workflow files)
- Running `bv`, `br`, `git status`, `git diff`

**Bypass:** `OMP_SKIP_BEADS_WORKFLOW=1` (emergencies only).

## bv Capabilities

| Category | Commands | Use When |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Triage & Planning** | triage, next, plan, priority | Entering any phase — what needs attention? |
| **Graph Analysis** | insights, alerts, suggest, forecast | Before /plan — graph metrics, cycles, staleness |
| **Labels** | label-health, label-flow, label-attention | During /brainstorm — where's the friction? |
| **History & Change** | history, diff | During /review — how did this file evolve? |
| **Sprint & Files** | burndown, file-hotspots, file-beads, file-relations | During /ship and /review — what else touches these files? |
| **Graph Export** | graph (json, dot, mermaid, html) | Visualizing dependencies or embedding in docs |

Always `--robot-*` for machine-readable output. Always `--format json` for parseable results. Prefer `--robot-triage` as the single entry point.

### Per-Phase Quick Reference

| Phase | Smallest Useful Query |
|-------|----------------------|
| `/brainstorm` | `bv --robot-triage --format json` |
| `/plan` | `bv --robot-plan --format json` |
| `/ship` | `bv --robot-file-beads <path> --format json` |
| `/review` | `bv --robot-file-hotspots --format json` + `bv --robot-file-relations --format json` |
| `/verify` | `bv --robot-alerts --format json` |
| `/close` | `bv --robot-suggest --format json` |


## br Conventions

- **Prefix:** `br-omp` (beads are `br-omp-<purpose>-<short-id>`, e.g. `br-omp-backbone-skill-1da`)
- **Artifacts:** `.beads/artifacts/<bead-id>/` — prd.md, plan.md, tasks.md, completion-evidence.json, review-report.md
- **Inspect before mutate:** `br show <id> --json` before any state change
- **Claim atomically:** `br update <id> --claim --json`
- **Sync safely:** `br sync --flush-only` after mutations
- **Resolve actor:** `ACTOR="${BR_ACTOR:-assistant}"` on all br mutations
- **One bead per session** — restart after `/close`
- **Priority:** P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (numbers, not words)
- **Notes survive compaction:** write COMPLETED / IN PROGRESS / NEXT / BLOCKERS in the notes field

Full reference in the `br` skill. Short ID resolution: suffix match via `br list` → Python filter → `br show`.

## Memory Protocol

### Tier 1 — Always In Context

`@memory/project/project.md` and `@memory/project/conventions.md` are inlined into this file via OMP `@` imports before injection. They are always present in the agent's context — no separate load needed.

Keep each focused and concise. Target ≤1KB for project.md (vision + current phase), ≤4KB for conventions.md (workflow + naming + rules), and ≤2KB for other Tier 1 files. Prune stale entries before adding new ones.

### Tier 2 — On-Demand (load when relevant)

| File | Load When |
|------|-----------|
| `tech-stack.md` | Task touches tooling, builds, dependencies, or verification |
| `gotchas.md` | Working near known hazards or debugging |
| `decisions.md` | Making architectural choices or reviewing past decisions |

### Rules

- **Write-before-compaction** — extract durable facts to memory files before context fills
- **Consolidate, don't append** — rewrite files periodically, merge duplicates, remove stale entries
- **Update on `/close`** — every bead completion checks if conventions/decisions/gotchas changed
- **No secrets** — never write credentials, API keys, or tokens to memory files
- **Stale memory is worse than no memory** — audit periodically, delete obsolete entries

## Honcho Operating Protocol

Honcho is the persistent memory and reasoning layer. It complements br/bv and memory files; it never replaces repository artifacts as the source of truth.

### Use Honcho For

- Durable user preferences and standing instructions
- Cross-session project decisions, constraints, and implementation style
- Recurring gotchas that help future agents choose better defaults
- Synthesizing prior context when a task may depend on user history

### Do Not Use Honcho For

- Temporary todos, current command output, or active scratch state
- Facts already available in repository files, bead artifacts, or tool output
- Secrets, credentials, tokens, or private keys
- Speculation or unverified claims

### Tool Selection

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Find prior durable context | `honcho_search` |
| Synthesize user/project preferences | `honcho_chat` |
| Persist an atomic durable fact | `honcho_remember` |

Use specific queries. Prefer "What durable implementation constraints has the user stated?" over "What do you know?".

### Reasoning Levels

- `minimal` — quick factual lookup
- `low` — default preference/context synthesis
- `medium` or `high` — multi-session synthesis that can affect implementation
- `max` — rare deep memory research only

### Per-Task Flow

1. Before planning or coding, query Honcho only when prior user or project context could change the decision.
2. Use the smallest reasoning level that can answer the question.
3. Keep repository files, bead artifacts, and observed tool output authoritative.
4. After completion, remember only new durable facts that should survive future sessions.
5. Never store secrets or transient implementation state.

### SDK/MCP Defaults

If wiring Honcho directly later: use one shared workspace when agents should share memory, one stable peer ID per real user, sessions scoped to repo/conversation/task/import, and `observe_me: false` for deterministic assistant/tool peers when configurable. Avoid many tiny sessions for trickle data because Honcho reasoning batches around roughly 1,000 tokens per peer/session.

## Philosophy

- **YAGNI** — if it doesn't solve a real problem today, it doesn't exist. No speculative abstractions.
- **Prune over pad** — more context is not better. Fill the window with just the right information.
- **Graph-informed** — every phase queries bv before acting. The graph knows more than you do about the codebase.
- **Commands + skills only** — no scripts, no machinery. Every gap solvable through better prompts and skill knowledge.
- **Cognitive tools** — skills are decision trees that tell the agent *what to do next*, not reference manuals that describe *everything about a topic*.
- **Progressive disclosure** — lean core + references for deep content. AGENTS.md is the map; skills are the territory.
- **br is the backbone** — all work is tracked, all state is in beads, all evidence is in artifacts.
- **bv is the brain** — robot commands for graph analysis. Query before you act.
- **Agent-native** — designed for AI coding agents from day one. Every artifact is a complete handoff.

## Guardrails
- **Ask before destructive** — confirm before deleting user code, force-pushing, or dropping beads
- **Never fabricate output** — no claim without observed evidence. If you didn't run it, don't report it.
- **Never expose secrets** — no credentials, API keys, or tokens in any artifact or memory file
- **Max 3 fix cycles** — if a bug survives 3 attempts, escalate. Don't loop.
- **Evidence before close** — `completion-evidence.json` must exist before `/review`, `/pr`, or `/close`
- **One bead per session** — stay focused. Don't multitask across beads.
- **Read before edit** — never guess file content. `read` the exact lines before touching them.
- **Scope to the active bead** — no "while you're in here" cleanups. If it's not in the plan, it's a separate bead.
